        Makes tax time a breeze. Instead of scrambling for documents, receipts, and statements at the end of the year, a good bookkeeper will keep everything safe and organized for you, and make sure you are alerted of errors before they become a problem. When it is time to file taxes, a good bookkeeper will provide you with a few reports to give to your tax preparer. It is as easy as that. You can save hundreds or even thousands of dollars in accountantsâ€™ fees by hiring a bookkeeper.</li>
        <li>

          <use xlink:href="svg-defs.svg#svg-checkmark" />
        </svg>
        Track the health of your business. A professional bookkeeper will provide you with several financial statements each month so that you can accurately see how much money is coming into your business, how much your business spends, and where your cash is flowing.</li>
        <li>
        <svg aria-hidden="true" class="checkmark">
          <use xlink:href="svg-defs.svg#svg-checkmark" />
        </svg>
        Catch errors. Because your bookkeeper is checking that every penny that comes into or out of your business matches your monthly statements, they will catch any errors that you may be too busy to notice, saving you from potential problems.</li>
        <li>
        <svg aria-hidden="true" class="checkmark">
          <use xlink:href="svg-defs.svg#svg-checkmark" />

        Protect yourself. In the dreaded event of an IRS audit, having your books kept accurately and your receipts organized will save you time, headaches, and potentially thousands of dollars.</li>

        If you ever plan on applying for a business loan or selling your business in the future, you are going to be asked to produce some pretty detailed financial statements. Good bookkeeping practices are essential for easily producing this information.</li>

        Oh, and itâ€™s tax deductable!</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="header h3">I help small businesses maximize profits by taking the guesswork out of bookkeeping.</h3>

      <p>You wear many hats as a small business owner. You focus your time and energy on getting and keeping customers and providing the best service for your clients. Generally, you are pretty organized and proactive when it comes to your business. You know that bookkeeping must get done in order to file your taxes. Maybe you have been trying to keep up with your books but you have a nagging feeling you are missing something or not doing it right.  Or maybe you are delegating the bookkeeping to a family member or employee and trusting they are doing it right. Or...maybe you have given up or never even started bookkeeping ðŸ˜¤. You wait all year until tax time and then plop a cardboard box of statements and receipts on your CPAâ€™s desk. Do you remember the look on their face? Do you remember the bill they charged you to do basically a yearâ€™s worth of bookkeeping in a very short amount of time?</p>

      <p>If this sounds like you, read on.</p>

      <blockquote class="pull-quote">
        <q>
          Just because you outsource your bookkeeping does not mean you will be kept in the dark about your finances. A good bookkeeper keeps an open line of communication and has regular check-ins with you.
        </q>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Imagine a world where tax time rolls around and you feel no stress. Your bookkeeper has been accurately tracking everything all year. She simply emails a few reports to your CPA, and your taxes are done!</p>

      <h3 class="header h3">How does this Virtual Bookkeeping thing work?</h3>

      <p>First, your bookkeeper will be setting you up with a cloud-based accounting software account and secure document storage. Your bank and credit card accounts will then be integrated with your accounting software. Got a shoebox of receipts? And yes, you DO need to keep your receipts! There are mobile apps that let you snap pictures of receipts, bills, and invoices and attaches them to the proper place in your accounting software. Pretty cool, right? We will be in contact via email, phone, video conferencing...there are many options for staying connected! Just because you outsource your bookkeeping does not mean you will be kept in the dark about your finances. A good bookkeeper keeps an open line of communication and has regular check-ins with you.</p>

      <p>Having an entrepreneurial spirit myself, there is nothing I could imagine more satisfying than helping other small business owners succeed. Bookkeeping is a vital, yet commonly overlooked and misunderstood component that every single business must have to thrive. This may sound odd, but I get a lot of satisfaction from reconciling a bank account, and making sure every penny is accounted for! When Iâ€™m not arming small businesses with all of the info they need to make wise financial decisions, I enjoy coffee, biking, pinball, and playing oboe. I live in Portland, Oregon with my husband and two cats, Abe and Farfel.</p>
